This repository includes four different files. Each of them is a different step
in the implementation of a basic web crawler as described in the Udacity course 
"Introduction to computer science" (https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101)

1. ud_webcrawler.py
Includes the first and most primitive version. Uses a basic index to sort out the keywords found and their associated URLs.

2. ud_webcrawler_hash.py
The index is substituted by a Hash table.

3. ud_webcrawler_dic.py
Makes use of the implemented dictionaty function in python to save up the results.

4. ud_webcrawler_rank.py
Includes a function to provide the best result (URL) for a given keyword. Also, the cache of a web page to use as example, provided in the aforementioned course.
